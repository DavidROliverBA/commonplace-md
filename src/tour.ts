# Start here

Commonplace keeps notes as plain markdown, so everything here opens anywhere.
Above this line are **properties**: click one to change it.

## Find your way
- **⌘O** finds a note by name, or makes one.
- **⌘K** lists everything you can do. Try typing "focus mode".
- Type **/** at the start of a line for headings, lists, tables and more.

## Try it now
- [ ] Tick this box
- [ ] Link to another note: type \`[[\` and pick [[Links and backlinks]]
- [ ] Make a note of a kind of thing: read [[Things, not files]]
- [ ] Look at [[Writing well]] for the quieter tools

When you're done, delete the Tour folder: these are ordinary notes.

    "Tour/Links and backlinks.md",
    `# Links and backlinks

Write \`[[\` and a note's name to link to it. If the note doesn't exist yet, following the link
makes it. Every note lists the notes that link to it under **Backlinks**, in the side panel, so
connections work in both directions without filing anything twice.

Tags such as #tour gather notes about a subject, across folders and types.

You can show part of another note in place with an embed:

![[Start here#Find your way]]

A note can be a **thing** with a type: a Person, a Book, a Project. Its type gives it a shape
(the properties above its text) and a page that lists every note of that type as a table.

[[Ada Lovelace]] is a Person: open her and look above the title. **Person** in the sidebar
lists everyone.

To make one from a line in any note, put the cursor on the line and use ⌘K → "Turn into a
typed note…". Try it on this line: Charles Babbage

- **Focus mode** (⌘K → "Focus mode") hides everything but the text and keeps your line in the
  middle of the screen. Escape leaves it.
- **Version history** (⋯ → Version history) keeps earlier versions and shows what restoring
  one would change.
- **Search** finds words and meaning; **Save** keeps a search in the sidebar.
- **Today** opens a daily note, for whatever doesn't have a home yet.
- With your own AI key (Settings → AI assistants), type **@** and an assistant's name to ask it
  about this note.
